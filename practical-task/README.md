# Automated On-Premises Management with Azure using Terraform

This Terraform project creates and manages Azure infrastructure, including virtual networks, subnets, and VMs, with a focus on automated on-premises management. The configuration ensures that each VM is provisioned in a dedicated resource group, with deletion protection, security rules, and a backup strategy implemented.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed
- Azure account with appropriate permissions
- SSH key for VM access

## Project Structure

- `main.tf`: Top-level configuration for Azure provider, virtual network, subnet, and VM module.
- `modules/vm/vm.tf`: Module for VM resources, including resource groups, security groups, network interfaces, VMs, and backup.

## Variables

### `tf-dev.tfvars`
### `tf-stage.tfvars`
### `tf-prod.tfvars`

These files contain the environment-specific variables for Terraform. In terms of CI/CD, the `terraform apply` command should be run three times with the specific environment file.

## Usage

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

2. **Apply the Configuration**:
    ```sh
    terraform apply -var-file="tf-dev.tfvars"
    terraform apply -var-file="tf-stage.tfvars"
    terraform apply -var-file="tf-prod.tfvars"
    ```

   Replace the `tf-dev.tfvars`, `tf-stage.tfvars`, and `tf-prod.tfvars` with the paths to your specific environment variable files.

## Improvements

- **Dynamic CIDR Assignment**: Implement dynamic CIDR assignments for networks and subnets to enhance flexibility and avoid IP conflicts.
- **Advanced Monitoring and Alerting**: Integrate with Azure Monitor or other monitoring tools for advanced monitoring and alerting, improving visibility and proactive issue detection.
- **Scalability Enhancements**: Optimize the configuration for larger environments with more complex networking requirements to handle increased load and performance demands.
- **Automated Testing**: Integrate automated testing using tools like Terratest to ensure infrastructure changes are validated before deployment.
- **Configuration Management**: Use Ansible or Chef for configuration management to ensure consistency and compliance across environments.
- **Security Enhancements**: Apply advanced security measures like network segmentation, encryption, and enhanced IAM policies to protect resources and data.
- **Terraform Policies**: Implement Terraform policies using Sentinel or Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce compliance and governance rules. This can include ensuring that all VMs have backup enabled, are in the correct regions, and have the necessary tags for cost management and security.

## Deployment and CI/CD

To deploy this infrastructure in a CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**:
    - Use a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps to automate the deployment process.
    - Create pipeline scripts that run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` commands for each environment (dev, stage, prod).

2. **Automate Variable Management**:
    - Store sensitive variables (like `client_secret`) in a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault).
    - Use environment-specific tfvars files to manage different configurations.

3. **Continuous Monitoring**:
    - Integrate monitoring and alerting within the CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor the health and performance of the deployed infrastructure.
    - Use tools like NodeExporter with Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization on the VMs and any other application metrics.

4. **Testing Infrastructure Changes**:
    - Implement automated tests using Terratest or similar tools to validate infrastructure changes before applying them to production.
    - Ensure thorough testing in the dev and stage environments to minimize risks in production deployments.
